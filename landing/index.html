			<h3>Frequently Asked Questions</h3>
			<dl>
				<dt>Q: Is Montessori education only for “gifted” children?</dt>
				<dd>A: Montessori education is for all children. Montessori educators believe that children have great capabilities when we introduce them to concepts at beneficial times, allow them to take responsibility for themselves and let them try things many people would assume young children weren’t capable of. As such, when many people see what children are capable of in a Montessori classroom, the assumption is often made that the children must be “gifted” when, in fact, they are just normal children!</dd>
				<dt>Q: Is Montessori education only for children with special needs?</dt>
				<dd>A: Montessori education is for all children, however, it can be very beneficial for many children with special needs. Montessori teachers are trained to understand and respond to the needs of each child and instruction is usually given individually or in small groups. The environment is non-competitive, co-operation is encouraged and respect for oneself, others and materials is emphasized. As such, children with special needs are rarely seen as being “different”, rather as another part of the diverse classroom community.</dd>
	
				<dt>Q: Is Montessori education only for wealthy families?</dt><dd>
				A: It is true that Montessori education often costs a little more than regular child care, as the cost of hiring specially trained staff and outfitting a classroom with Montessori materials tends to be more expensive. At Atlantic Montessori School, we are doing our best to keep our fees affordable so that more families will find Montessori education accessible for their child.</dd>
				
				<dt>Q: Are all Montessori schools religious?</dt>
				<dd>A: Atlantic Montessori School is a non-denominational school. There are some religiously affiliated Montessori schools in existence but Montessori schools exist on all continents of the world, in places with many different religious beliefs. In North America especially, most Montessori schools are non-denominational.</dd>
				
				<dt>Q: Are all Montessori schools the same?</dt>
				<dd>A: No, they are not. The name “Montessori” was never copyrighted so it is possible for schools to call themselves Montessori schools without actually having any kind of Montessori programming, materials or Montessori trained staff. It is important to do some research into what Montessori education is so that you can determine whether the school you are seeing follows the Montessori philosophy. Atlantic Montessori School will, upon opening, begin the process to become AMI accredited through&hellip; We promise to uphold Maria Montessori standards for early childhood education and a Montessori curriculum.</dd>
				
				<dt>Q: Doesn’t Montessori education have a lot of unusual ideas?</dt>
				<dd>A: If you’ve ever seen child sized furniture (it was actually invented by Maria Montessori in the early 1900’s) or know of the idea of children “soaking things up like sponges” (Maria Montessori called that concept “the absorbent mind”) then you’re already familiar with some aspects of Montessori education. In fact, all modern early childhood education has been influenced by Maria Montessori’s ideas to some degree. Many people initially find Montessori philosophy to be a little different than what they’re used to but usually, after seeing how well young children respond to it, many people come to feel that it makes a lot of sense.</dd>
				
				<dt>Q: Are the children just allowed to do whatever they want in a Montessori classroom?</dt>
				<dd>A: The Montessori philosophy is about allowing a child freedom within limits. Children in a Montessori classroom will have a long period of open work time. In this time, they are free to choose from a large variety of developmentally appropriate materials to which they have been previously introduced. They will be free to choose where to work and with whom. They will not, however, be free to disturb the work of others or damage the materials or classroom environment.</dd>
				
				<dt>Q: The Montessori materials look so strange to me. How am I supposed to understand what everything is?</dt>
				<dd>A: At first glance, a Montessori classroom will seem somewhat foreign, with all kinds of unusual looking materials with uses that aren’t immediately obvious. Our teachers have had to train extensively to understand the materials and all of their uses so we wouldn’t expect parents to understand them right away! Rest assured, though, after your child tells you about “The Pink Tower, “, “The Brown Stair” or “Trinomial Cube” a few times, you’ll start to learn the lingo. If you’re ever in need of any clarification, your child’s teacher would be happy to answer any questions.</dd>
